  <h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! I'm <strong>MD. Nayeem Islam</strong>, a dedicated and enthusiastic student currently pursuing a BSc in Computer Science and Engineering at Shahjalal University of Science and Technology.</p>

  <p>My journey into the world of technology began with a deep curiosity about how websites work, which led me to start learning <strong>web development</strong>. I’m currently focused on building a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I enjoy experimenting with small projects to improve my skills.</p>

  <p>Outside of coding, I enjoy learning new tech trends, exploring open-source projects, and watching programming tutorials. My long-term goal is to become a skilled full-stack developer and contribute to real-world software solutions.</p>

  <p>I believe in continuous learning, problem-solving, and staying curious. I’m excited to grow in the field of web development and make a meaningful impact in the tech community.</p>
